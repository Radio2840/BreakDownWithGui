https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oOEnWQZIePs - next help

Starting thinking about collision...

1. I need to get class that will be moveing my ball ^^
2. before my ball will move my game checking how far my ball is from every brick.
3. ## the borders that I need to thing about it (position - I think it will be the center of label (I need to check it))
4. when my ball sprite is from brick far as 0px the brick will disapear
5. ### how do I know what brick? - table of brick and jumping on one another thats why I need table of bricks
6. When the brick desapear one point is added (creating new label and deleting old. or changeing label)
7. when my ball is under the height of plank ball is moved to the center and the life label is changeing from 3.png to 2.png
